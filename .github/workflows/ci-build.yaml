# CI Pipeline - Build and Push Docker Image
# Purpose: As a platform engineer, this automates the build process so developers
# don't need to build/push images manually. This ensures consistency and traceability.

name: CI Build and Push

# Triggers: When code is merged to main (production builds) or on PRs (testing builds)
# Platform reasoning: main = releasable artifacts, PRs = validation only (no push)
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

# Environment variables - centralized configuration
# Makes it easy to change registry or image name across all steps
env:
  REGISTRY: docker.io
  IMAGE_NAME: jamesmd1996/weather-app

    # Permissions: Principle of least privilege
    # Platform engineers define minimal required permissions for security
    permissions:
      contents: read      # Read code from repo
      packages: write     # Push to container registry

    steps:
      # Step 1: Get the code
      # Uses v4 for latest security patches and features
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up Docker Buildx
      # Buildx enables advanced features: multi-platform builds, better caching
      # Platform reasoning: Faster builds = faster feedback for developers
      - name: Set up Docker Buildx
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v3

      # Step 3: Log in to Docker registry
      # Uses GitHub's built-in secrets for secure authentication
      # Only on main branch (not PRs) - PRs just test the build
      #Platform reasoning: Secrets shouldn't be exposed to PR builds from forks

      # Step 4: Generate image tags and metadata
      # Platform reasoning: Consistent tagging strategy is critical for traceability
      # Tags created:
      #   - main-abc123 (branch + commit SHA) - for dev deployments
      #   - main (branch name) - for tracking latest on branch
      #   - latest (if main branch) - convenience tag
      #   - semver tags (if you create git tags like v1.0.0)
      - name: Extract metadata (tags, labels)

# Step 5: Build and push the Docker image
      # Platform reasoning: This is the artifact that gets deployed
      # - Uses cache from GitHub Actions for faster builds (gha)
      # - Only pushes if not a PR (PRs just validate the build works)
      # - Applies all tags from previous step

          cache-to: type=gha,mode=max                  # Save all layers to cache

      # Step 6: Show what was built
      # Platform reasoning: Visibility - you need to know what image tag to deploy
